## About this pattern

### What problem does this solve?

Inconsistent placement and language selection interface components can be a barrier to users with limited English-language skills, preventing them from easily finding and accessing content in another language.

### When to use this pattern

Use this pattern when the content is available in two languages.

### When to consider something else

{:.usa-content-list}
- When content is available in three or more languages, see the [Select from three or more languages]({{ site.baseurl }}/patterns/select-a-language/three-or-more-languages/) pattern.
- When only selected multilingual content is available in some languages, see the [Selected content available]({{ site.baseurl }}/patterns/select-a-language/selected-content/) pattern.

### What's the solution?

Place the language selector button at the top of the screen above site navigation to allow the user to toggle between two languages. Place the toggle on the top right of the page for left-to-right-languages and on the top left of the page for right-to-left languages, if possible.

          What to do
        </h3>
        <div class="do-dont__content">
          <ul>
            <li>Place the language menu button in the upper corner of the screen for consistency. If possible, flip the arrangement of the header for right-to-left languages. The language button should be positioned at the top right of the page for left-to-right languages and on the top left for right-to-left languages.</li>
            <li>Make the language access button a single, independent element.</li>
            <li>Include the language toggle in the header so that it remains visible and in the same position as the user scrolls up and down a webpage if the website has a “sticky” or “fixed” header.</li>
            <li>Take users to an equivalent page that includes the same or similar content.</li>
            <li>Capitalize the name of each language (for example, English, Español).</li>
            <li>Strongly consider labeling the name in the common, native language like <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Español</span> (Spanish) or <span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">简体字</span> (Chinese - Simplified).</li>
          </ul>

          What not to do
        </h3>
        <div class="do-dont__content">
          <ul>
            <li>Do not create a dead end for users by taking them to a page with little or no meaningful content.</li>
            <li>Strongly consider whether including icons or graphics on the language selection button offers communication value, as these may represent different concepts to different cultures.</li>
            <li>Do not use flags or country codes to indicate languages. Flags do not map to languages; Arabic, for example, is spoken in many countries. The country code <code>ES</code> may not be universally understood to indicate Spanish.</li>
            <li>Avoid auto-redirecting language based on detecting location or browser settings. This can be confusing and disorienting.</li>
            <li>Do not combine this element with other navigation items.</li>

### Usability guidance

{:.usa-content-list}
- **Ensure there’s enough color contrast** between the button, the text inside the button, and the site background to ensure readability.

### Accessibility

{:.usa-content-list}
- **Customization.** As you customize, make sure you follow [accessibility guidelines for buttons]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/button/#button-guidance).
- If the text will be visually presented as a button but coded as a link, it is recommended to **add ARIA role="button"** so that screen readers announce it as a button. Additionally, JavaScript will also need to be added so that keyboard users can activate the button using both the Enter and Spacebar keys. See [Understanding Success Criterion 4.1.2 - Understanding WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html) for more information.
- **Use the HTML `lang` attributes** to set the language of the page (`<html lang='en'>`, for example). See [H57: Using the language attribute on the HTML element](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H57.html) for more information.
- Consider including a **prominent in-page notice or link** in addition to the link in the header, in order to increase visibility for the user.
