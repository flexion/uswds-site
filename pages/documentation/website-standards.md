## USWDS can help agencies comply with federal website standards

Agencies can more easily build accessible, mobile-friendly websites, and comply with federal website standards, by using the U.S. Web Design System.

Federal agencies are required to comply with website standards per the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (IDEA). Standards will align with the 21st Century IDEA, OMBâ€™s memo on Delivering a Digital-First Public Experience (M-23-22), and other relevant policy requirements and best practices.

[Understand the policy framework and requirements in the 21st Century IDEA and M-23-22](https://digital.gov/resources/delivering-digital-first-public-experience/).
