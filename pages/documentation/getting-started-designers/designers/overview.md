See the [design tokens]({{ site.baseurl }}/design-tokens/) section for more on USWDS system styles and palettes.

As a complement to this visual style guidance, we strongly recommend you use [18F’s Content Guide](https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/) when writing language for government services.

## USWDS for designers

<div class="site-note"><strong>Note:</strong> USWDS 3 design assets are maintained in Figma and Sketch formats. We've provided an official USWDS design kit for Figma since November 2024. We've stopped maintaining our Adobe XD assets.</div>

USWDS components and tokens are available in their application-specific project file formats. Download the assets and all associated fonts and images from the links below. Find more complete installation instructions at [our USWDS for designers GitHub repo](https://www.github.com/uswds/uswds-for-designers):

{% include download-buttons-design.html %}

For some users, it can be easier to [install the USWDS design kit for Figma directly from the Figma community](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1440921849343185329/uswds-design-kit-beta) instead of downloading the file from our GitHub repo.

Here on the USWDS documentation site, you’ll find HTML mockups of common UI components designed to follow USWDS’s visual style guide. To view the specs of each design live on the website (like padding, margins, stroke weight, line-height, and so on), use your browser’s developer tools.

### Retired design files
USWDS no longer maintains the following design files. The most recent versions remain available for download at the links below. While USWDS is no longer maintaining these files, we'd love to hear from any teams that are using them and adding new components when new versions of USWDS are released. [Send us an email](mailto:{{ site.uswds_email }}).

#### 1.6.10

## Accessibility requirements

All of our designs meet the [WCAG 2.0 AA accessibility guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) and are compliant with [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act](http://www.section508.gov/). If you choose to customize these designs, please make sure they continue to meet the requirements listed in the “Accessibility” section of each design.
