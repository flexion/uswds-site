subhead: A report about what’s next for the U.S. Web Design System

chapter: true

  - heading: Overview
    description: |-
      In September 2020, we brought together researchers, designers, engineers, and policymakers to conduct research across dozens of federal agencies to help support emergency response efforts related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

  - heading: Why is this important?
    title: Purpose
    description: |-
      Across the federal government, agencies are working to improve their everyday interactions with the public. How do we provide easy access to critical services? How do we deliver faster and more efficient touch points? How do we ensure transparency and build trust? The answer to these questions has increasingly become: deliver better digital services.

      One piece of the widespread federal effort is implementation of the design system, which provides principles, guidance, and code that makes it easier for the federal government to deliver mobile-friendly, accessible digital services.

      But we need more. There are still gaps in how the design system can better meet agency needs, so they in turn can better meet the needs of the public.

      Through this research, [we looked to agency teams to help us define what digital transformation looks like](./introduction), both in the near-term and in the future.

  - heading: What we learned
    title: Findings
    description: |-
      Though agencies start with different goals and capabilities, we discovered [they follow a common journey with similar needs](./findings) when it comes to successfully adopting, using, and maintaining the design system.

  - heading: Our future vision
    title: What’s next
    description: |-
      We’ve identified specific opportunity areas that will move us closer to a design system that meets the needs of teams across every agency — what we call our Near Star (short-term) and North Star (long-term) vision. Working toward these visions is our way of ensuring the design system continues to change over time and stays connected to the teams that are using it.

  - heading: What you can do
    title: Get involved
    description: |-
      Let’s transform the way we design and deliver digital government with and for the people.

      Many of the ideas in this report are big-picture thinking, requiring time, collaboration, and strategies to come to fruition. But right now, [you can begin by understanding the value and benefits of using the design system](./get-involved/) to deliver better digital services.

      Use the conversation starters throughout the report to prompt discussions with your managers and team members.

      Also, if you’re interested in exploring these ideas — or in learning more about the design system — [join our community](../about/community/) and get involved.

      The first workshop for federal employees will be in Spring 2021, and we hope to hold ad hoc workshops in the future as well. We also hold regular calls on the third Thursday of each month.

      We’ll provide regular updates on our progress in [monthly calls](https://digital.gov/events/), the [public Slack channel](../about/community/), and the [product roadmap](../about/product-roadmap/).
