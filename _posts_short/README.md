# Creating short posts for the What's new feed

The feed on our [What's new page](https://designsystem.digital.gov/about/whats-new/) is powered by the files in two different directories:
- `/_posts`: These are the long format posts generated by [Jekyll posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/). These files will automatically generate both a post preview for the news feed and a separate page for the post content.
  - See the README in the /_posts directory for instructions on creating a post
- `/_posts_short`: These are the short format previews that appear in the news feeds. These files do _not_ generate a related post page, and instead often link to different pages on our site or other locations.
  - See the instructions in this document to learn how to [create a new short post](#creating-a-new-short-post) and [customize a short post's metadata](#customizing-post-metadata).

## Creating a new short post

To create a new short post, create a new branch then add a new file to this directory (`/_posts_short`) with a filename in the form:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
```

where:

- `YYYY` is the 4-digit year (`2024`) of the publish date
- `MM` is the 2-digit month, with a leading zero (`01` for January, `02` for February, etc.)
- `DD` is the 2-digit day of the month, also with a leading zero
- `title` is the so-called "slug" used in the post URL, and should be all lowercase with no spaces (e.g. `my-post-title`)

>[!note]
> The YYYY-MM-DD date set in the file name will:
> - Display as the "date" in the post
> - Sort the post in reverse chronological order (newest items first) in the news feed.

Next, in the file's contents, copy and paste the following:

```
---
title:
author:
tags:
excerpt:
preview_url:
---
```

Note that no other content is needed outside of the page's [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/).

## Customizing post metadata

You can customize the post's metadata by defining the following in the file's [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/):

| Key | Description | Required |
|--------|--------|--------|
| title | The title of the post | Yes |
| author | The author(s) listed in the byline | No |
| tags | The tag that describes the category of the post. Multiple tags can be added, but only the first tag will appear above the post title. | Yes |
| excerpt | The post summary that will be included in the post preview | Yes |
| preview_url | The url that will be added post preview header link. Add a value of "none" when you want the header to not have a link. | Yes |

Here is a sample implementation of a short post:

```md
---
title: Lorem ipsum dolor
author: Suzy Q, Jane Doe, and Joe Schmoe
tags:
- Lorem ipsum
excerpt: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus egestas sed felis eget sodales.
preview_url: https://github.com/uswds/uswds/discussions/
---
```

Here is a sample implementation of a short post without a link:

```md
---
title: Lorem ipsum dolor
author: Suzy Q, Jane Doe, and Joe Schmoe
tags:
- Lorem ipsum
excerpt: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus egestas sed felis eget sodales.
preview_url: none
---
```
