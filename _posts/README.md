# Creating post pages for the What's new feed

The feed on our [What's new page](https://designsystem.digital.gov/about/whats-new/) is powered by the files in two different directories:
- `/_posts`: These are the long format posts generated by [Jekyll posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/). These files will automatically generate both a post preview for the news feed and a separate page for the post content.
  - See the instructions in this document to learn how to [create a new post](#creating-a-new-post), [customize a post's metadata](#customizing-post-metadata), and follow [post conventions](#post-conventions).
- `/_posts_short`: These are the short format previews that appear in the news feeds. These files do _not_ generate a related post page, and instead often link to different pages on our site or other locations.
  - See the README in the /_posts_short directory for instructions on creating a short post

## Creating a new post

To create a new post, create a new branch then add a new file to this directory (`/_posts`) with a filename in the form:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
```

where:

- `YYYY` is the 4-digit year (`2024`) of the publish date
- `MM` is the 2-digit month, with a leading zero (`01` for January, `02` for February, etc.)
- `DD` is the 2-digit day of the month, also with a leading zero
- `title` is the so-called "slug" used in the post URL, and should be all lowercase with no spaces (e.g. `my-post-title`)

This date will:
- Display as the "date" in the post
- Will sort the post in reverse chronological order (newest items first) in the news feed.

See the [Jekyll documentation about creating posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#creating-post-files) for more info.

Next, in the file's contents, copy and paste the following:

```
---
title:
category: About
author:
tags:
---

This is my introductory paragraph.

## This is a heading

And this is another paragraph.
```

## Customizing post metadata

You can customize the post's metadata by defining the following in the file's [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/):

| Key | Description | Required |
|--------|--------|--------|
| title | The title of the post | Yes |
| category | The site category that ties the post to the side navigation. The value for this should always be "About". | Yes|
| author | The author(s) listed in the byline | No |
| tags | The tag that describes the category of the post. Multiply tags can be added. The first tag will appear above the post title. | Yes |
| excerpt | The post summary that will be included in the post preview | Yes |
| lead | The first paragraph of your post displayed in large ("lead") text. When present, the lead will be used as the "excerpt" in the post preview. | No |
| expiration_date | The date when this post will receive the "This content is outdated" alert. This is typically set 2 years from the publication date. | No |

Here is a sample front matter customization:

```md
---
title: Lorem ipsum dolor
category: About
author: Suzy Q, Jane Doe, and Joe Schmoe
tags:
- discussion
- news
excerpt: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus egestas sed felis eget sodales.
---
```

## Post conventions

In general, the following conventions should be followed in your posts:

1. Prefer Markdown files (`.md`) to HTML (`.html`), and remember: You can always embed HTML in Markdown, but not the other way around.

1. When linking to other pages on the site, **always** prefix URIs with the Jekyll base URL (`{{ site.baseurl }}`):

    ```md
    ## Good
    Check out [what's new]({{ site.baseurl }}/whats-new/)!

    ## Bad
    Check out [what's new](/whats-new/)!
