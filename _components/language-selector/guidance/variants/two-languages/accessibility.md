- **There should be enough contrast between the button and the page background, as well as the button background and any button text or icons, to ensure readability.**
- **The language of each page should be identified using the HTML lang attribute** (`<html lang="en">`, for example). Please see [H57: Using the language attribute on the HTML element](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H57.html).
