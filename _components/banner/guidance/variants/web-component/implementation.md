- Some `.mil` websites do not belong to an official U.S. Department of Defense organization. These sites should adapt the **Official websites use .mil** section to use more technically accurate language: “A **.mil** website operates under the approval of the U.S. Department of Defense.” This can be set by adding that text to the `domain-text` slot, as demonstrated in the **.mil** example.
- The banner should directly follow the `skipnav` component.
- We realize this documentation won’t cover all use cases, build environment, or tooling. If you have questions, you can ask USWDS community members in our [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/discussions) or [Slack channel](https://designsystem.digital.gov/about/community/#join-the-community-2), or contact us directly at [uswds@gsa.gov](mailto:uswds@gsa.gov). We’ll be expanding this documentation in the future and your questions and feedback help us understand what you need to get started with this variant.
