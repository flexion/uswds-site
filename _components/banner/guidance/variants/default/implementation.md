- Some `.mil` websites do not belong to an official U.S. Department of Defense organization. These sites should adapt the **Official websites use .mil** section to use more technically accurate language: “A **.mil** website operates under the approval of the U.S. Department of Defense.”
- The banner should directly follow the `skipnav` component.
- Set the banner background color with `$theme-banner-background-color`. Banner text will update automatically.
